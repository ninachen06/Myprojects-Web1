<p class="Test"> I didn't have as many friends as all you may have had in your high school days. Instead I got bullied. Not because of my weird clothes, not because of my boring humor and not because of my appearance. It was because of my stupidity. I didn't learn as fast as the other students, I was slow at understanding in class and had to take extra classes just because I was behind my classmates. They could just read from a booklet and understand it word by word but my brain doesn't work like that. I'm not like the other students, I'm different. In fact all people are different, so why is school learning the same way to everyone when all people have different ways of learning. 
 is not the engineers, the teachers or the congress who are the future for our country. It's the 70 million children that struggle in school, the ones that are trying to get great grades, the ones that stay up all night studying for an exam and the ones that are competing with each other to see who will get an A. It does not matter if we have figured out how to create a flying car if we do not have a future to use it. We don't have a future without the children! (sigh)

<p class="Test2"> I grew up in Nevada, I lived there throughout my childhood. The school from back then is exactly the same as of the school today. I know this because I have worked as a teacher. The teachers are forced to learn the way they do today because the department of education commands them to do so. To teach students how to be a robot! (sigh)

    Not only does the school turn students into robots but also takes away the children's ability to find their special gifts and as well takes away the opportunity for children to show their creativity. We need passion and creativity to change our country into the better so that we don't get stuck in the past. How are we going to find a cure for cancer if we all have the same way of thinking? 
    
    To all of the 70 million children that want to make a great living for the future, I am here for you. I promise that I will make education more fun and give you more chances to create your fantasy and creativity. I will make America's future better again!

    We all want America to be the best country in the world and for that to happen we must make progress. By finding a cure for cancer or solving the problem of rape. However we can't do this if we don't have all kinds of ideas and creativity. It is very difficult to be the best country but together we can make it happen!
    
    God bless you! .
